# NRF Impact Assessment Service

SQS polling worker for processing nutrient impact assessments, with CDP platform compliance.

**Architecture:** Long-running worker with minimal Flask health endpoint (see [docs/cdp-adaptation.md](docs/cdp-adaptation.md) for rationale)

**Status:** Phase 1 complete - Hello world worker with SQS polling

## Requirements

### Python

Please install python `>= 3.12` and `pipx` in your environment. This template uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the environment and dependencies.

```python
# install uv via pipx
pipx install uv

# sync dependencies
uv sync

# source python venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Environment Variable Configuration

The worker uses Pydantic's `BaseSettings` for configuration management in `worker/config.py`, automatically mapping environment variables to configuration fields.

**Key configuration:**
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (default: `eu-west-2`)
- `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`: AWS endpoint (for LocalStack in local dev)
- `AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL`: SQS queue URL for job messages

In CDP, environment variables need to be set using CDP conventions:
- [CDP App Config](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-documentation/blob/main/how-to/config.md)
- [CDP Secrets](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-documentation/blob/main/how-to/secrets.md)

For local development - see [instructions below](#local-development).

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting Python code.

#### Running Ruff

To run Ruff from the command line:

```bash
# Run linting with auto-fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Run formatting
uv run ruff format .
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run linting and formatting checks automatically before each commit.

The pre-commit configuration is defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

To set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Set up the git hooks
pre-commit install
```

To run the hooks manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### VS Code Configuration

For the best development experience, configure VS Code to use Ruff:

1. Install the [Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) for VS Code
2. Configure your VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
        "source.organizeImports.ruff": "explicit"
    },
    "ruff.lint.run": "onSave",
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
            "source.organizeImports.ruff": "explicit"
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration will:

- Format your code with Ruff when you save a file
- Fix linting issues automatically when possible
- Organize imports according to isort rules

#### Ruff Configuration

Ruff is configured in the `.ruff.toml` file

### Docker

This repository uses Docker throughput its lifecycle i.e. both for local development and the environments. A benefit of this is that environment variables & secrets are managed consistently throughout the lifecycle

See the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` for details

## Local development

### Setup & Configuration

Follow the convention below for environment variables and secrets in local development.

**Note** that it does not use `.env` or `python-dotenv` as this is not the convention in the CDP environment.

**Environment variables:** `compose/aws.env`.

**Secrets:** `compose/secrets.env`. You need to create this, as it's excluded from version control.

**Libraries:** Ensure the python virtual environment is configured and libraries are installed using `uv sync`, [as above](#python)

**Pre-Commit Hooks:** Ensure you install the pre-commit hooks, as above

### Running the worker

The worker runs as a Docker container using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start worker with LocalStack (for local SQS)
docker compose --profile worker up --build

# Watch mode for hot-reloading
# Press 'w' after services start to enable watch mode
```

The worker will:
- Start Flask health server on port 8085
- Poll SQS queue for messages (20 second long-polling)
- Process messages and log results
- Gracefully shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT

**Send test message:**

```bash
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 sqs send-message \
  --queue-url http://localhost:4566/000000000000/nrf-assessment-queue \
  --message-body '{"test": "hello world"}'
```

**View logs:**

```bash
docker compose logs worker -f
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest -v

# Run end-to-end integration test
uv run pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

The e2e test starts Docker Compose services, sends a test message, and verifies processing.

## Health endpoint

The worker exposes a single HTTP endpoint for CDP platform compliance:

| Endpoint       | Description                               |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `GET: /health` | Health check endpoint (returns `{"status": "ok"}`) |

The health endpoint runs on port 8085 via a Flask server in a background thread, using Waitress WSGI server for production-grade concurrent request handling.

**Why Flask instead of FastAPI?** See [docs/cdp-adaptation.md](docs/cdp-adaptation.md) for the architectural decision.

## Pipelines

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)
